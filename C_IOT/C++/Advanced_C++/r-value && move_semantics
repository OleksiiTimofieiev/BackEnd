// r-value, move semantics

// - motivation:
// to avoid copy of a huge data

- if rvalue -> no copy by compiler
- if return of a huge object, 
- operator && => to have the constructor
- technique to move pointer instead of data
- std::move => static_cast<...> == cast of referense from lvalue to rvalue
