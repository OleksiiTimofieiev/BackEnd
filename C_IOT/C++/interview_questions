- friend keyword => to have the access to the private area of the class,
oftenly used for testing purposes
- auto: used for the type deduction
- code bloating: use of inline keyword
- const_cast: remove const from the variable
- decltype: auto func(...) -> decltype(a+b)
- diff pointer & referense
reference and variable have the same address in memory
pointer has its own address
reference:
reassignement is not possible, no arithmetic operations, no null value
- dynamic_cast => cast to find correct down cast
- explicit => to use a specific type, to avoid implicit call to the constructor
- function chaining <- return reference to the object
