///// monolit vs microservices
{
    - to reduce the load on the program
    - single responsibility principle
    - monolit == complexity
    - huge codebase
    - divida et impera
    - business logic => single responsibility => DB
    - too much microservices is bad
    - communication expenses
}

///// microservices in monolith
{
    - decompse of the project
}

///// making microservices
{
    - rpc == call a method
    - jsonrpc
}

///// serialization
{
    - json = 40 bytes, no schema format => unpack field, then data type
    - binary format: packed binary data => easier to pack/unpack
    - protobuf == fixed serialization structure => code can be generated for other languages
