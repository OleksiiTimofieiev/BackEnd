- every long request should have timeout
- need to propagate timeout through the request
- how much time is left in the middle of the request
- need to store that information somewhere so the middle of the request can stop
- multiple RPC - if one falls, maybe better to cancel all of them
- context: background, with cancel, with timeout
- to end sub request or the parent request
- not just timeout, but to end RPC call early
- any function that can block should have timeout
