fork
thread
------ big overhead for the above (~1000 connections) <= stack (memory), switch context (additional thing in scheduler table)

------ register event in the kernel
register event => sleep => wakeup the process
events: ready to read/write from/to the descriptor, signal, timeout
realisation:
- select (FD_ISSET)/poll == O(n)
- kQueue/epoll == list of events of the correspondent type
