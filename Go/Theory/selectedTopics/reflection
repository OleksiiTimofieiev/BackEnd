- no info on representation
- interface can be type asserted to extract the value of that interface == i.(type)
- to handle the multiple input data types => flexibility
- reflection - another tool to obtain information about the type and value of the variable
- reflection == set of functions === reflect package
- three core concepts:
type = reflect.TypeOf(...)
kind
value
- funcs: Name, Type, Kind
- ValueOF
- TypeOf
- all interfaces in go contain value and a type descriptor
