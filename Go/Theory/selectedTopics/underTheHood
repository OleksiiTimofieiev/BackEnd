- runtime: code being run which we didn`t call:
scheduler
GC
memory allocator
std
debug information
- goroutines == green threads, we can controll resources
- GOMAXPROCS == amount of available process CPUs
- preemptive/cooperative concurrency
- FIFO queue = no controll on priority
- guarantee of execution time
- goroutines may be transferred beetween thread == cache mish,
runtime.LockOSThred == to avoid moving from P in scheduler
- newproc => go smth => structure added to array => one round of scheduler->schedule()
- mstart() {... ; schedule()}
- func main {
    gc()
    ...
    alloc()
    ...
    main_main()
}
