Basic types: {
    - machine representation == RAM == more faster then Java and Python
    - go money for financial calculations
    - strict types, types have to be casted before any operation related to other type
    - boolean is not able to be converted to int or vice-versa
    - no pointer manipulation
    - Error() => nil or non-nil
    - initialized by zero or correspondent type during variable declaration: nil, zero, etc., all members get zeroed for aggregated types
}

Strings: {
    - byte == unit8
    - rune == int32
    - string == immutable sequence of characters
    - passed by reference
}
