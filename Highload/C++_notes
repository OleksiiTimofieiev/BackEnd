- long processing of requests
- non-full request processing periodically
- connection failures
- decrease of free memory

- automatic balancing

- pillars:
high-availability
diagnostics
latency
scaling

- C++ => direct memory access, no GC, no stop of the world
- move semantics => no copying of the objects
- copy elision => if possible to be with copies, eliminate copies <= O2 == compiler optimizations
- memory barriers: memory_order_*
- RAII == resource aquisition is initialization == every memory allocation will have the destructor
- shared, unique, weak *_ptr == smart pointers
- each malloc is a system call
- std::allocator : allocator, allocator shared
- placement new where possible in order to use sys call as less as possible
- mutex: mutex, timed, recursive, shared, shared_timed
- avoid sys calls => one file with offset method => external index in headers
- avoid huge page tables
- PTHREAD_SETAFFINITY_AP => bide CPUs to core to avoid cache miss



?: 
- friendly C++ code
- threading in highplos
