- AMQP (advanced message queue protocol)
- broker == message routing
- exchange == receives messages and distributes them beetween queues
- binding == exchange-queue binding
- JSON format
- rabbit pushes messages to consumers

distribution strategies:
- fanout: exchange without routing => to all queues
- direct
- topic

pros:
- a lot of client libraries
- easy to administer: has admin in brovser
cons:
- hard to manage configs with highload
