- data link layer:
briadcast/multicast(request to all servers and each sever decides on its own wether to reply - %0 for example) || local balancer (selecting the IP where to send request)

- network layer:
same but changes destination IP (proxy/reverse proxy)
high load on balancer with reverse traffic

- transport layer:
same logic
ECMP algo

- global:
DNS round robin
redirect

- anycast:
to the nearest server in the nerwork

Balancing algorithms:
- weighted round robin
- least connections
- destination hash scheduling, source hash scheduling
- sticky session (client is connected to a specific servers and staying on it)
