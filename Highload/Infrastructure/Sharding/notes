- ssd => for fresh
- types: vertical, horizontal
- partitioning = in one DB, sharding == beetween different DB
- sharding approaches:
* range == kinda different intervals [10-20] [40-50],
not always good as data distribution may not be equal 
* key == hash function to distribute data
directory == separate DB with key to shard
- routing:
on client => more harder client code, updates on client when shards are being changed
proxy => client knows nothing about sharding, single fail point
coordinator => client knows nothing about sharding, single fail point
