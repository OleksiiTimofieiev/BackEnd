- message broker for big data
- more reliable then rabbitMq ?
- producer -> broker -> consumer [zookeeper]
- topic: array list
- replication: master slave, write only to leader
- master maydie, and leader will be chosen -> async replication == some loss of data,
clean || unclean leader election
data will always be lost
leader even may be chosen if all is ok
- leader change without a loss:
request.required.acks = 1
request.required.acks = -1 => successfull write to all specific partitions
min.insync.replicas.per.topic = 2
some small overhead of producer,
way out:
incync.replicas = 2
replication factor = 3
- offset:
earliest - latest
how to save offset is main for the consumer
at least once
exactly once -> to save data in offsets in kafka atomically
- not always correctly distrubetes nodes
- better to monitor:
disks, network, scaling, leader selection, partition deferred, response time
