- apache -> context change
- nginx -> one process => one thread => several file descriptors => lib event 

+:
no context change
-:
no call stack, kinda reactive programming
handler can be spoiled(CPU overuse, ReDoS) => all events may be blocked
if handler exits, whole queue may be lost

event loop == libuv
