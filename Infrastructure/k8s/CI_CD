- dockerfile -> docker build -> docker-image -> docker gitlab registry -> docker-image + tests
- .helm[backend.yaml] -> helm install -> k8s 
- docker image should contain everything for autonomous start
- git branch tag == temporary images
- git tag == prod images
- backend should not be updated if migration not finished, hack:
init containers, if successful (while netcat db connection, migration is successful) -> go;
maybe already a mechanism for monitoring such a dependency
- remember about gracefull shutdown

possible schema:
- deployment for apps accumulated by pods
- statefull set for DB
- migration: DB schema changes
