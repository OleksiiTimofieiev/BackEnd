- key element is cluster of nodes
- nodes: worker/master
- Master node (server which ha 3 processes):
kube-apiserver, 
kube-controller-manager(if node fails, containers will be moved to other nodes), 
kube-scheduler(on which node which container), 
etcd
- Worker node: 
kubelet==docker management api,
kube-proxy==network interface of a server, manages iptables
- One master-many workers
- Image registry
- use of DSL (YAML)

- Features:
service discovery and load balancing: access via DNS or port
storage orchestration: attach local or cloud storage to container
automated rollout and rollback: update of a service via green-blue deployment 
automated bin packing: necessary resources indicated-> K8s will select suitable node 
Secrets manager
Kibernetes cloud services

- Container:
logging(stdout)
supervision(healthcheck, etc.)

- unit of creation: pod[several or one container in one network namespace, 
folder, labels(key/value), selectors for labels for service descovery]
infrastructure: YAML

k8s primitives:

+ pod (set of connected containers):
type
metadata
specification

+ replicaSet: set of pods => supervision, auto-scaling
+ deployment controller (for stateless apps): replicaSet + history of old replicaSets (hisory save period is configurable) + 
deploy process (sequentially downscaling of previous version)
+ service discovery -> service: DNS + Virtual IP + Load balancer + Selector (tier + version for example): ClusteIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer, ExternalName
sending trafic for labeled pods being active
+ job: pod + successful completion (return 0) 
+ cronjob: job + cron
+ volume: size + access type (ReadWrite-once(one user - only us),
ReadOnly-many,ReadWrite-many(NFS, clusteFS)) + 
storage class(slow, normal,fast) - 19 ways of realization of a storage class;
can be connected to pod, replicaSet, deployment
+ stateful set(statefull apps): pods with communication with each other with stable name,
can be: each pod works with its own volume
+ ingress: hostname + path + TLS + Service
has public api, request by hostname or URL
+ migration: alter databases for its new configuration
+ secrets

- High availability:
Deployment (will recreate necessary amount of pods) and StatefulSet (will not recreate pod if not triggered manually)
PodAntiAffinity: one pod per node
PodDisruptionBudgets: kill one pod per one time
